The three basic types of cloud services are:
Computing - These include EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, Auto-Scaling, and Lightsat.
Storage - These include S3, Glacier, Elastic Block Storage, Elastic File System.

AWS REGION=A PHYSICAL LOCATION-consists of multiple(3min) AVAILABILITY ZONES
AWS AZ=1 or more discrete data center
An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region
AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where AWS clusters data centers. Each AWS Region consists of multiple (three or more), isolated, and physically separate Availability Zones (AZ) within a geographic area. Each Availability Zone (AZ) has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected via redundant, ultra-low-latency networks

The 5 Pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework

Security - Identity and key management, Encryption, Security monitoring and logging, dedicated instances, compliance, governance 
Cost Optimization - RI and spot, volume tuning, service selection, consolidated billing, resource utilization, decommisioning
Reliability -  Service limits, multi A-Z regions, scalability, health checks and monitoring, networking, self healing/disaster recovery
Performance Efficiency - Right AWS Services, storage arhitecture, resource utilization, caching, latency requirements, planning and benchmarking
Operational Excellence -CI/CD, runbooks, playbooks, game days, Infrastructure as a code IaaC, RCAS

AMAZON S3
S3- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance
- Amazon S3 provides the most durable storage in the cloud and industry leading availability. Based on its unique architecture, S3 is designed to provide 99.999999999% (11 nines) data durability and 99.99% availability by default, backed by the strongest SLAs in the cloud.
- S3 is secure, private, and encrypted by default
- S3's free tier offers a 12 month free trial that provides 5GB of Amazon S3 storage in the S3 Standard storage class; 20,000 GET Requests; 2,000 PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST Requests; and 100 GB of Data Transfer Out each month
- Amazon S3 stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for objects. To store your data in Amazon S3, you first create a bucket and specify a bucket name and AWS Region. Then, you upload your data to that bucket as objects in Amazon S3. Each object has a key (or key name), which is the unique identifier for the object within the bucket
- Storage classes:
S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard, S3 Express One Zone, S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA), S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA), S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, S3 Glacier Deep Archive, and S3 Outposts

AMAZON ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD EC2
EC2-Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.
- An EC2 instance is a virtual server in the AWS Cloud. When you launch an EC2 instance, the instance type that you specify determines the hardware available to your instance. Each instance type offers a different balance of compute, memory, network, and storage resources

You can create and manage your Amazon EC2 instances using the following interfaces:
-Amazon EC2 console - You can use EC2 Instance Connect to connect to your instances using the Amazon EC2 console or the SSH client of your choice.
-AWS Command Line Interface
-AWS CloudFormation
-AWS SDKs
-AWS Tools for PowerShell
-Query API

Pricing for Amazon EC2:
-Free Tier
-On-Demand Instances-Pay for the instances that you use by the second, with a minimum of 60 seconds, with no long-term commitments or upfront payments.

-Savings Plans- You can reduce your Amazon EC2 costs by making a commitment to a consistent amount of usage, in USD per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years.

-Reserved Instances- You can reduce your Amazon EC2 costs by making a commitment to a specific instance configuration, including instance type and Region, for a term of 1 or 3 years.

-Spot Instances- Request unused EC2 instances, which can reduce your Amazon EC2 costs significantly.

-Dedicated Hosts- Reduce costs by using a physical EC2 server that is fully dedicated for your use, either On-Demand or as part of a Savings Plan. You can use your existing server-bound software licenses and get help meeting compliance requirements.

-On-Demand Capacity Reservations-Reserve compute capacity for your EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration of time.

-Per-second billing-Removes the cost of unused minutes and seconds from your bill.

AWS Budgets- help you receive alerts when the reservation utilization falls below the defined threshold
AWS Budgets gives you the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed your budgeted amount.
You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. Reservation alerts are supported for Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon ElastiCache, and Amazon Elasticsearch reservations

AWS Pricing Calculator - AWS Pricing Calculator lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. You can model your solutions before building them, explore the price points and calculations behind your estimate, and find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs. This enables you to make informed decisions about using AWS

AWS CloudTrail - AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With AWS CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure.
